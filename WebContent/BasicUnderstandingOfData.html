<h2>Basic Understanding of Data</h2>

<ul>
Our logical model, Bio-Nexus considers both the models Fact Constellation and Bio-Star. We arrived on our decisions based on three factors:  
<li>Complexity</li>
<li>Storage</li> 
<li>Extensibility.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The main goal of biological data warehousing is to provide a global and integrated view of living systems. Earlier, 
the modelling data spaces included sample, gene annotation and gene expression. The new model introduced, also takes into 
account datasets for clinical and genomic data in the warehouse design. The proposed data warehouse is designed to integrate various 
biomedical datasets for studies of human diseases. Clinical data, including clinical test results, MRI images and drug responses of patients 
are taken into account. A relatively large collection of microarray gene expression data is available for this research. Other genomic datasets, 
including sequences and annotations, microarray gene expression data, protein-protein interaction data and protein domain information, are also 
available.
</p>
<p>
The logical model for clinical and sample data space is the fact constellation. This is because when we combine the different m tables and 
bunch them into one table, the number of query joins reduces and the populated data tables are non- sparse and hardly contain any null values.
</p>
<p>
The logical model for gene sequence is the Biostar. This is because we can have the flexibility of extending any dimension in future.
